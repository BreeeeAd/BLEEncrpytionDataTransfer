# BLEEncrpytionDataTransfer
An Bluetooth data transfer app using MD5 &amp; AES 256  encryption.

Generally, there are two kinds of the encryption algorithm: one-way encryption algorithm, and the bidirectional encryption algorithm. Bidirectional encryption is the most commonly used in the encryption algorithm. It encrypts plaintext data into ciphertext data that cannot be directly understood. When necessary, we can use certain algorithms to decrypt the encrypted ciphertext data into the original plaintext data. Bidirectional encryption is suitable for secret communication, such as, in the network registered users or purchase goods, submitting real name, identity card number; bank account number, credit card password and other information should be encrypted by bidirectional encryption algorithm then transmit through the internet. So that can effectively prevent hackers "eavesdropping" to ensure the safety of data. At the same time, the site after receiving our data, you can decrypt the algorithm to get accurate information. We will introduce both kinds of algorithms which are MD5 and AES algorithms.
